# Solomon-Track

A lightweight tracking application scaffold named Solomon-Track.

This repository contains the source for Solomon-Track — a small app intended to track items, events, or simple metrics. This README gives a short overview and clear, PowerShell-friendly instructions to detect the project type and run the app locally.

## Overview

- Purpose: provide a simple, extensible tracker app that can be used as a starting point for demos, prototypes, or small internal tools.
- Status: README is generic — update the sections below with exact commands if your project uses a specific framework (React, Next.js, Express, Flask, Django, .NET, etc.).

## Features (example)

- Create / Read / Update / Delete simple tracked items
- Lightweight UI and API (if present)
- Easy to extend and integrate with a database or external services

## Checklist — what I changed

- Add a clear project overview — Done
- Add step-by-step how-to-run instructions for common project types — Done

## How to detect the project type

Open PowerShell in the project folder and run one of these commands to see which ecosystem the repo uses (look for these files):

```powershell
Test-Path package.json       # Node / npm / yarn
Test-Path requirements.txt   # Python (pip)
Test-Path pyproject.toml     # Modern Python projects (Poetry / build tools)
Get-ChildItem -Filter *.sln  # .NET solution file
Test-Path index.html         # Static site
```

If any of those return True (or you can see the file), follow the platform-specific steps below.

## Run instructions (PowerShell)

The exact commands depend on the stack. Pick the section that matches your project files.

1) Node.js / npm (if `package.json` exists)

```powershell
# install dependencies
npm install

# run in development (common scripts: dev, start)
npm run dev      # or: npm start

# build and run production
npm run build
npm start
```

2) Python (if `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` exists)

```powershell
# create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the app (replace with your entrypoint, e.g. app.py, main.py)
python main.py
```

3) .NET (if a .sln or .csproj exists)

```powershell
# restore and run the solution or project
dotnet restore
dotnet run --project .\YourProjectFolder\YourProject.csproj
```

4) Static site (if `index.html` exists)

```powershell
# open the file in the default browser
Start-Process index.html

# or serve locally with a small static server (Node must be installed)
npm install -g http-server
http-server . -p 8080
```

## Configuration

- If your project uses environment variables, create a `.env` file and copy any `.env.example` or documented variables.
- Example `.env` entries:

```text
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///db.sqlite"
```

## Troubleshooting

- If `npm install` fails, ensure Node.js and npm are installed (node -v; npm -v).
- For Python issues, verify the Python version (python --version) and that the virtual environment is activated.
- If a command is missing, check which ecosystem the project targets and share the key files (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `.sln`).

## Next steps / How I can help

- I updated this README with generic, platform-agnostic instructions. If you want, I can:
  - Inspect the repository and replace the placeholders with exact commands if you grant access to the project files, or
  - Add a small `Makefile` / `tasks.json` for convenient cross-platform scripts.

If you'd like precise run steps, please tell me which files are present (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `.sln`, or the app entrypoint like `app.py`, `index.js`, etc.).
